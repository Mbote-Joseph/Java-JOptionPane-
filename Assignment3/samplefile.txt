Information Technology (IT) is becoming the cornerstone to any economy in the world. Since the spread of the Internet and communication applications in their diversified forms, IT became an integrated part of everyone's life in modern society. In UAE, IT plays a major role in the development of the society. Therefore, it is only natural to have the United Arab Emirates University offer a degree program in IT in its various specializations. The College of Information Technology offers a bachelor of science degree in Information Technology (BSc in Information Technology) in seven specialization tracks: Intelligent Systems (INSYS), Software Development (SWD), Information Security (SEC), Networking (NETW), E-Commerce (ECOM), Enterprise System (ENSYS), and Computer System Design (CSD).
